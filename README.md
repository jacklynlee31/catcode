# Cat Code
For my final project at The Iron Yard, I created an interactive game for students who want to learn how to code.

The game is fun and easy to use. It includes a simple authorization for users to sign up for an account, login and logout. Users are then led through three levels that teach them the basics of using code.

The initial planning of the game included a list of what the user should be able to do while playing the game:
* See a 'start' screen.
* Press 'play' to initiate the game.
* See a 'game' screen.
* See the 'cat' character.
* See instructions.
* See the text box where they will write their code.
* Write code inside of the text box.
* Get a notification that the code is 'right' or 'wrong'.
* See the cat move depending on the code that is written.
* Move to the next 'level' in the game.
* Get a notification when the game ends.


While I was developing the game, I created a series of templates that makes it easy for me to go in and easily edit different levels. This system also makes it easy to add new levels. In the future I hope to make longer levels that teach intermediate level code.
